# Other IBM Mainframes (IBM 1401, 1620, 7090/7094, System 3)
Although the original intention of this list was to focus on the IBM System/360 and its descendants, [RattyDAVE](https://github.com/RattyDAVE) reminded me of SimH, which emulates some of IBM's other mainframes, so I am including a section for those machines on this list as well.
## Emulators
